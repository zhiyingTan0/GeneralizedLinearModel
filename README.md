# GeneralizedLinearModel

Linear model: model fitting, hypothesis testing, aliasing and multicollinearity,  interactions,  response  transformations,  residuals.  Exponential  families  and  link functions.  Generalized  linear  models:  maximum  likelihood,  iteratively  weighted  least-squares, quadratic  algorithms  for  maximum  likelihood,  asymptotic  distribution  of  likelihood  estimators, deviance  statistic,  residuals.  Models  for  count  data:  Poisson  regression  and  log-linear  models, goodness-of-fit,  contingency  table  analysis,  structured  log-linear  models,  iterative  methods  for model  fitting,  overdispersion  and  underdispersion.  Models  for  binomial  and  multinomial  data: binomial and logistic regression, 2 x 2 tables and case-control designs, overdispersion, multinomial responses,  conditional  logistic  regression,  matched  pairs.  Special  topics  (if  time  permits):  gamma regression, quasi-likelihood and generalized estimating equations, estimation of the link function.Learning
